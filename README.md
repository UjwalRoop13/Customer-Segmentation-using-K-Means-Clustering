# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

##  Overview
This project demonstrates how **unsupervised learning** can be used to segment customers into meaningful groups based on behavioral features.

The Iris dataset is used as a **proxy for customer data** to showcase clustering techniques commonly applied in marketing and analytics.

##  Business Use Case
Customer segmentation helps organizations:
- Design targeted marketing campaigns
- Improve customer retention
- Optimize pricing strategies

##  Methodology
1. Feature scaling using StandardScaler
2. Elbow method to find optimal number of clusters
3. K-Means clustering
4. Visualization and centroid analysis
